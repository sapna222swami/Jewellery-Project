	<p>We are one of the oldest business families in India with a family legacy of 109 years in business. Started for the noble cause of nation-building and self-sustenance in a pre-independent India, the forefathers believed ethical, honest and transparent business practices should form the foundation of the group.</p>
Personally, I believe Kalyan Jewellers' major achievement is the trust<P>we have earned from millions of people across the length and breadth of a huge subcontinent like India, and abroad in the GCC.
We have always believed in fair and transparent business. We have believed that the customer should be understood so well that we know his needs much before he understands them himself. We have believed that an enlightened customer is the best customer. These are the simple principles that have helped us reach where we are today.
Today, Kalyan Jewellers has 129 retail stores spread across INDIA and MIDDLE EAST. Pampered by your unbound love and support and with the blessings of the Almighty, we believe we are in the right path towards the accomplishment of our vision to open stores and serve customers across the world.</P>
